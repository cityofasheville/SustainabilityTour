  <h2>Installing an Configuring the Map Tour Application</h2>
    <a name="top"></a>
    <p>This read-me file explains how to set up the Map Tour application to run on your web server and modify its content to suit your purposes.</p>
    <div class="heading">Table of Contents</div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#deploy">Install the Web application</a>
      </li>

    <h3 class="heading">Install the Web application</h3>
    <p>
    These instructions assume that you have a Web server like <a href="http://www.iis.net/">Internet Information Services(IIS)</a>
    installed and configured on your machine. If you are using another Web server, the general installation steps will be the same but you will need to check your Web server's documentation for specific information on deploying and testing the application.
  <ol>
      <li>
        Copy the contents of the zip file into your web server's root directory. In IIS, the default location for the web server's root folder is 
        <code>c:\inetpub\wwwroot</code>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Test the page using the following URL: <a href="http://localhost/maptour/index.html">http://localhost/maptour/index.html</a>. 
      </li>
    </ol>
    <a href="#top">Top</a>
    <a name="configure"></a>
    <h3 class="heading">Configure the application</h3>
    <p>
      There are two basic steps in configuring  the application.  The first step is to format your data (locations and photos) so that the application can use it.
      The second step is to set the application's configuration variables so that the application will present your specific information.
  <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Formatting your Data </strong>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The application data is stored in a CSV file, which is downloaded and read at runtime. It is therefore required that the CSV file be formatted in the expected way so the application can read it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p>              A sample CSV file (<em>locations.csv</em>) has been provided. It contains 7 fields:        </p>

    <p>The <em>locations.csv</em> contains sample data which we included for your reference. Feel free to remove all the sample records and use the <em>locations.csv</em> as your starting data template. Once you have populated <em>locations.csv</em> with your own data, you're ready to move on to step 2, Setting the Configuration Variables.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <li><strong>Setting the Configuration Variables</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Open <em>index.html</em> and scroll down to the section marked &quot;begin config section&quot;. There are 8 variables that you can modify. The final variable is optional.</p>
